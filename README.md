# PowerBI
In this repository I will be commiting my powerbi dashboards that I do as part of my learning process.

I recommend to see my dasboards online by clicking in the links below:

*(Disclaimer: All my dashboards are made with fictional and public datasets)*

## Practice 1 

A marketing campaign as a little aproach to loading data into PowerBI, with basic visual elements and different interactions between them

## Practice 2

An employee ranking dashboard, based on their performance solving incidences. This project digs deeper in PowerBI functionalities as multiple ppages, bookmarks, different themes and tooltips

## Datahack Final Project

A marketing campaign acceptance dashboard. In this one, i put special effort in the visual aspect and I used all what i knew at this point
